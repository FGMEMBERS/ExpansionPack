FlightGear Expansion Pack documentation
=======================================

:Release: |version|
:Date:    |today|

The FlightGear Expansion Pack is a project that provides various shared
modules that can be used by aircraft to easily add certain features. It
was created in order to reduce the amount of copy/paste that is happening
among many aircraft in FlightGear and to promote code reuse.

This documentation explains how to install the expansion pack, which
modules are provided, and how to use these modules in your own aircraft.
